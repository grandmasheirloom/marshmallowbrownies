<hr>
<center><p><h4>This recipe is (or was) a family secret. My grandma loved baking, as a hobby, as an activity shared with friends and lastly as something to pass down to my mother, along with her delicious recipes. Now I'm sharing her beloved brownie recipe, made with love, with you. It's simple, made with everyday ingredients, but the result is pure magic. Whether you're baking it for a special occasion or just craving something sweet, these brownies will always feel like home.</h4></p>
<p><h4>This finger-licking dessert is probably worth avoiding if you are on a diet, as it's difficult to stop eating it once you start (seriously, it's delicious). These homemade brownies are rich, squishy and irresistibly chocolatey. The fudgy base, with refreshingly sweet and sharp marmelade and topped with foamy marshmallow with a crunchy surface makes the texture simply addicting. Made from simple ingredients but packed with rich cocoa flavour, it creates an incredibly, unbelievably, tasty dessert.</h4></p></center>

<p><center><h4>The brownie is a beloved American dessert, and its origins are a bit murky. Most food historians agree that it emerged in the late 19th century, around the 1890s, in the United States. The most common story is that the brownie was created by accident. One tale suggests that a baker forgot to add baking powder to a batch of chocolate cake batter, resulting in a denser, fudgy treat.</h4></center></p>
<p><center><h4>Another theory points to the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where a chef is said to have made a small, portable cake for ladies attending the fair. The treat was easy to carry and eat, which made it a hit at the event. The first published recipe for brownies appeared in 1904 in the *Home Cookery* cookbook.</h4></center></p>
<p><center><h4>Over time, brownies became a versatile dessert, with variations such as cake-like brownies, chewy brownies, and fudgy brownies. Today, they’re a popular treat around the world.</h4></center></p>

<p><h3 style="color:rgb(45, 181, 163)"><u>Here's what you'll essentially need:</u></h3></p>
<ul>
    <li><h5>250g butter</h5></li>
<li><h5>5 (medium) eggs</h5></li>
<li><h5>300g sugar</h5></li>
<li><h5>3tbsp cocoa</h5></li>
<li><h5>300g flour</h5></li>
<li><h5>300ml milk</h5></li>
<li><h5>10g baking powder</h5></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><h3 style="color:rgb(45, 181, 163)"><u>Preparation step by step:</u></h3></p>
<p><h3><b>Step 1</b></h3></p>
<p><h4>Mix the butter with the sugar using a spoon(a wooden one would be perfect) and add the egg yolk, milk, flour, cocoa and baking powder. Bake the composition in the oven at 170°C for about 25 minutes. The time depends on the oven, so it's best to check it from time to time with a toothpick to see if it's baked and make sure not to burn it.</h4></pr>
<p><h3><b>Step 2</b></h3></p>
<p><h4>Prepare the syrup: 200ml water+5tbsp sugar</h4></p>
<p><h3><b>Step 3</b></h3></p>
<p><h4>Use an electric mixer to stir the egg whites with 200g of sugar until you get a white foam.</h4></pr>
<p><h3><b>Step 4</b></h3></p>
<p><h4>Once the cake is baked, add the syrup and let it absorb. Add a marmelade of your liking on top (in my humble opinion apricot or plum might be the best choice) and lastly the egg foam.</h4></pr>
<p><h3><b>Step 5</b></h3></p>
<p><h4>Last but of course not least, bake the cake in the oven for another 5 minutes until the white on top turns brown-ish.</h4></p>
